# Quick start

Once you clone this repo, these commands show how to compile and run the code inside.  You need  `ant` to following these instructions;  refer to [cs56-rational-ex02](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-pconrad/cs56-rational-ex02) and the article on [`ant`](http://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/ant/) for more information.

| To do this: | Type this command: |
|-|-|
| Make a jar file | `ant jar`|
| Run from the jar file | `java -jar build/rational.jar`|
| Compile | `ant compile` |
| See the targets in the ant file | `ant -p` |
| Run the JUnit tests | `ant test` |
